# Tribal Quest

Tribal Quest is the adventurer-facing Coworld surface for the shared Tribal
Fortress world. Quest owns its public `/player` route, controls, scoring, and
adventurer-centered viewport; the installed Fortress runtime owns the grid
world, civilizations, settlements, NPC policies, terrain, and step loop.

There is no supported local Quest simulation mode anymore. `worldRuntime` is
always `fortress`, and missing Fortress runtime code should fail at build or
startup instead of falling back to the old route.

## Running

Use a sibling Fortress checkout while the shared runtime is local:

```sh
BITWORLD_PATH=${BITWORLD_PATH:-$(pwd)/../bitworld}
TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH=${TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH:-$(pwd)/../coworld-tribal-fortress}
nim c \
  --path:src \
  --path:$BITWORLD_PATH/src \
  --path:$BITWORLD_PATH \
  --path:$TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH/src \
  -o:out/tribal_quest \
  src/tribal_quest.nim
./out/tribal_quest --address:127.0.0.1 --port:2000 --fortress-engine-path:$TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:2000/client/player?address=ws://localhost:2000/player&name=human`

Quest expects the Fortress checkout on the Nim path to expose
`quest_runtime.runQuestAdventurerPlayerServer`. That runtime is called directly;
there is no alternate `/adventure` proxy or compile-time fallback.

Optional config fields:

```json
{
  "worldRuntime": "fortress",
  "fortressEnginePath": "../coworld-tribal-fortress",
  "adventurerRole": "adventurer"
}
```

## Fortress Adapter

`src/tribal_quest/fortress_engine.nim` keeps the Quest-owned adapter contract:

- validates that only `worldRuntime = fortress` is accepted
- discovers `TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH` or `../coworld-tribal-fortress`
- targets a 768 by 480 Fortress world with 30 town agents per team
- caps Quest adventurer slots at 64
- maps button masks into `adventurer.input` payloads
- parses the local `view_plane` fields Quest needs for an adventurer crop

The old Party Progressor mechanics are now product reference material for what
should move into the Fortress engine or Quest adventurer presentation. They are
not a second runtime in this repo.

## Project Layout

- `src/tribal_quest.nim` starts the Quest `/player` surface on Fortress.
- `src/tribal_quest/fortress_engine.nim` contains the Quest-side adapter
  contract.
- `plan.md` is the integration source of truth for the Quest half.
- `tests/tests.nim` contains lean adapter-contract checks.
