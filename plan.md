# Tribal Quest / Fortress Shared Engine Contract

Last updated: 2026-05-29

## Canonical Shape

Tribal Quest is the adventurer Coworld game. Tribal Fortress is the shared world
engine and fortress/town Coworld game.

- Fortress owns the authoritative grid simulation.
- Quest owns its public `/player` adventurer route.
- Fortress `/player` remains town/fortress/civilization control.
- Quest `/player` claims one adventurer in the Fortress world.
- There is no Quest local simulation fallback.
- There is no production `/adventure` route.
- There is no Python bridge in the Quest runtime path.

The integration is Nim-to-Nim for performance and simplicity.

## Fortress Must Provide

Quest expects `TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH/src` to expose a Nim module named
`tribal_village_engine`.

The module should provide a small API:

```nim
type
  FortressEngineConfig* = object
    maxSteps*: int
    seed*: int
    adventurerViewRadius*: int
    aiMode*: string
    worldWidth*: int
    worldHeight*: int
    townAgentsPerTeam*: int
    adventurerSlots*: int

  FortressEngine* = object

proc initFortressEngine*(config: FortressEngineConfig): FortressEngine
proc close*(engine: var FortressEngine)
proc claimAdventurer*(engine: var FortressEngine, slot: int, teamId = -1): int
proc releaseAdventurer*(engine: var FortressEngine, slot: int): bool
proc submitAdventurerInput*(engine: var FortressEngine, slot: int, payloadJson: string)
proc step*(engine: var FortressEngine)
proc adventurerObservationJson*(engine: FortressEngine, slot: int): string
```

That API owns worldgen, terrain, civilizations, NPC policies, claim tracking,
action decoding, stepping, and local crop export.

## Quest Must Provide

Quest imports `tribal_village_engine`, starts the engine, and wraps it with its
own Coworld `/player` route.

Quest is responsible for:

- token-to-adventurer-slot binding
- websocket lifecycle for `/player`
- converting player input masks to engine payload JSON
- rendering or adapting the adventurer-centered view
- Quest scoring and replay output
- Quest-specific docs and future reference bots

The current Quest surface code lives in `src/tribal_quest/player_surface.nim`.
It consumes `adventurerObservationJson` crops and packs them into the existing
BitWorld 128 x 128 player frame protocol.

Quest should not duplicate Fortress world simulation code.

## Action Contract

Quest forwards player input as button masks:

```json
{"type":"adventurer.buttons","buttons":33}
```

Button bits match BitWorld:

- `up = 1`
- `down = 2`
- `left = 4`
- `right = 8`
- `a = 32`
- `b = 64`

Tests may send raw engine actions:

```json
{"type":"adventurer.action","action":28}
```

Fortress owns decoding masks into move, attack, use, and future role abilities.

## Observation Contract

`adventurerObservationJson(engine, slot)` returns a JSON object with stable
fields Quest can parse:

- `type = "engine.adventurer_observation"`
- `control_profile = "Adventurer"`
- `slot`
- `agent_id`
- `team_id`
- `civilization`
- `position`
- `hp`
- `max_hp`
- `done`
- `view_plane`
- `sprite_view`
- `observation`

`view_plane` and `sprite_view` are local adventurer-centered crops. They are not
full-map payloads.

## Defaults

- world runtime: `fortress`
- world size: `768 x 480`
- town agents per team: `30`
- adventurer slots: `64`
- Quest tactical crop: `11 x 11`
- default adventurer role: `adventurer`

## Validation

Quest-side checks:

```sh
BITWORLD_PATH=${BITWORLD_PATH:-$(pwd)/../bitworld}
nim r --path:../src --path:$BITWORLD_PATH/src --path:$BITWORLD_PATH tests/tests.nim
TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH=${TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH:-$(pwd)/../coworld-tribal-fortress}
nim c --path:src --path:$BITWORLD_PATH/src --path:$BITWORLD_PATH --path:$TRIBAL_FORTRESS_PATH/src -o:out/tribal_quest src/tribal_quest.nim
git diff --check
```

If `tribal_village_engine` is missing from the Fortress checkout, the build
should fail immediately on that import. Do not revive local Quest simulation or
add a Python bridge to make it pass.
